## Working Statement Principles
https://github.com/w3c/devcouncil/issues/7

* This is the last piece of the working statement
* want to adopt a consent framework
* let's discuss that next time with https://github.com/w3c/devcouncil/issues/4
* how are we going to measure this
* we should talk about how to apply these in the context of the w3c and interact with the W3C IPR
  * should depend on who we are talking to at the given time
* how do we think about applying these globally
  * we are thinking about inherent rights and yes they ought to be applied differently
  * there is an inherent problem of power when it comes to working on a globalized platform like the www

## Funding Proposal Updates
* we increased the salary to 15k
* boaz to send this out late march

## Decision Framework - start the discussion/process.
* how do we decide which groups to engage with on both sides?
* we want to prioritize under-represented voices in the w3c
    * how do we create a guide to getting involved?
    * can we change under-represented to "people who have been actively excluded", or "black middle class people", 
    * can we look at who is excluded and try to center the people who are most harmed by the technology at hand
    * how can we do this safely for people?
    * could web we want be a good fit since they are already semi-insiders?
* we want to act as another step for how proposal writers to make sure that they've gotten enough feedback from the developer communities, and poeple who use web browsers communities
    * is WG too late? should we look at the CGs?: https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/
